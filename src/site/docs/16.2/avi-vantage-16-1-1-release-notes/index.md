* AV-7924 Web interface: After configuring a virtual service using the Basic popup, if the server port number was edited in the pool configuration popup and then cleared again in the popup, the field did not re-inherit the port number from the Basic virtual service popup.

* AV-7413 APIC: A maximum of 3 CPUs per SE was supported.

* AV-7386 If a primary SE was up, the Controller would send health checks to its secondary SEs even if the pools in those SEs were down.

* AV-7310 SE names could not contain underscores.
