This article maps Avi Vantage's pre-16.2 SE-group high availability modes to those supported thereafter.

Prior to 16.2, HA modes ranged from dedicated SEs to shared best effort, as depicted in figure 1.

### Details

Pre-16.2 modes can be mimicked by choosing one of three modes and setting as many as seven options. [Note: Prior to 16.2, there was no equivalent to <a href="/docs/16.2/legacy-ha-for-avi-service-engines">legacy active/standby HA</a>.] Refer to table 2 for suggested settings of the fields labeled A-F in figure 3.

A variety of factors will affect the maximum number of SEs deployed in any one of the four modes, including:

* Native SE balancing versus BGP-based.
* Available resources. 

To mimic a "dedicated SE active/active" environment, the maximum SE count of the active/active group should be double maxVS, the maximum number of virtual services intended for the SE group.
