Avi Vantage license expiration is a significant event. It is important to ensure the license does not expire.

It is recommended to set up a license expiration alert to proactively prompt administrators before the Vantage license expires. Alerts may be sent by email, Syslog, SNMP trap, or using a custom ControlScript. Navigate to Operations > Alerts to configure a new alert and determine its destination with the alert action.

New certificates may be managed and downloaded from the Avi customer portal website.
