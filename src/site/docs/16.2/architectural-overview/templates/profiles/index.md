Avi Vantage relies on Templates and Profiles to group together collections of settings into a single, reusable object. A profile may be used by multiple objects such as Virtual Services referencing the same TCP Profile. By making a change to the TCP Profile, all associated Virtual Services will inherit the change.

Avi Vantage supports the following Templates and Profiles:

* <a href="application-profile/">Application Profile</a> 
* <a href="tcpudp-profile">TCP/UDP Profile</a> 
* <a href="persistence-profile">Persistence Profile</a> 
* <a href="health-monitor-profile">Health Monitor Profile</a> 
* <a href="analytics-profile">Analytics Profile</a>
