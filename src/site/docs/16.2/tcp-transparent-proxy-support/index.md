title: TCP Transparent Proxy Support
layout: 16.2
---
Avi Vantage does not currently offer support for transparent TCP proxy.  This may also be called routed mode or default gateway mode.  In this mode, servers would point to the Service Engine's IP address as their default gateway, mitigating the requirement for the Service Engine to Source NAT (SNAT) traffic sent to the destination servers.

Please contact Avi support for an updated timeline for support of this architecture.
