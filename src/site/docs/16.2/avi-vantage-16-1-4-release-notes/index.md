## What’s New in 16.1.4

This release contains fixes but no new features.

## Issues Resolved in 16.1.4

* AV-10520: Postgres failure during Avi Controller upgrade causes the upgrade to be aborted.
* AV-10362: APIC: Logical interface (LIf) sharing did not work across Virtual Routing Frameworks (VRFs) for APIC graph instances. 

## Issues Resolved in 16.1.3

* AV-10313: When a virtual service was scaled out across two or more Avi SEs, packets could be dropped between the primary SE and the secondary SE due to maximum transmission unit (MTU) limits.
* AV-9584: Error threshold for packets with TCP window size 0 adjusted to reduce unnecessary significant logs. (Default threshold changed to a minimum of 5 events or 2% of total traffic for the virtual service.)
* AV-9579: In certain circumstances, the postgres database could fail to start on a follower Avi Controller node in a 3-node Controller cluster. This caused the configuration on the follower node to go out of sync.
* AV-9481: OpenSSL upgraded to v1.0.2h.
* AV-9319: Accept-Encoding headers for gzip packets were incorrectly rewritten.
* AV-9315: IP forwarding for the Avi Controller was unnecessarily enabled in non-container infrastructures.
* AV-9248: (OpenStack) If a project’s UUID changed (for example, because a project was recreated in Keystone), but an older tenant with the same UUID still existed in Vantage, this caused issues with logging into the newly created tenant.
* AV-9022: If an Avi SE failed to reconnect following upgrade, the upgrade could take longer.
* AV-9005: Long Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) could cause an Avi SE to stop working. 

## Performing the Upgrade

Upgrade prerequisite: current version of Avi Controller must be 15.3 or later.
