As part of the technical support, Customer may be required to enable a feature in the Licensed Products that will allow the Licensed Products to transmit data and information to Avi Networks regarding Licensed Products bugs, errors, and other similar technical support issues. Avi Networks will only use such data and information for the purposes of providing the technical support services and, in a form not identifiable to Customer, for the purposes of improving the Licensed Products.

Unless otherwise stated in the Order Form, Avi Networks reserves the right to increase Subscription Fees for any renewal term upon not fewer than thirty (30) days’ prior written notice. All payments must be made in U.S. dollars. Any portion of the Subscription Fees that is not paid when due will accrue interest from the due date until paid, at the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. Customer or Reseller agrees to pay any attorney or collection agency fees in the event an attorney or collection agency is retained to collect monies past due hereunder (whether or not litigation is instituted) as well as any and all court costs.

Customer will be responsible for payment of all such taxes (other than taxes based on Avi Networks’ income), fees, duties, and charges, and any related penalties and interest, arising from the payment of the Subscription Fees or the delivery or license of the Licensed Products to Customer. Customer will make all payments of the Subscription Fees to Avi Networks free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding taxes; any such taxes imposed on payments of the Subscription Fees to Avi Networks will be Customer’s sole responsibility, and Customer will provide Avi Networks with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence as the Avi Networks may reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have been paid.

**5.****Warranties.**

**5.1 Performance. **For a period of thirty (30) days after the initial delivery of the Licensed Products to Customer (the “Software Warranty Period”), Avi Networks warrants that the Licensed Products, when used as permitted under this Agreement and in accordance with the instructions in the Documentation (including use on a computer hardware and operating system platform supported by Avi Networks), will operate substantially as described in the Documentation. Avi Networks does not warrant that the Customer’s use of the Licensed Products will be error-free or uninterrupted. Avi Networks will, at its own expense and as its sole obligation and Customer’s exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty, use commercially reasonable efforts to correct any reproducible failure of the Licensed Products to operate substantially as described in the Documentation (an “Error”), as reported to Avi Networks by Customer in writing during the Software Warranty Period or, if Avi Networks determines that it is unable to correct the Error, Avi Networks will refund to Customer the initial Subscription Fees actually paid, in which case this Agreement and Customer’s right to use the Licensed Products will be terminated. Any such Error correction provided to Customer will not extend the original Software Warranty Period. The foregoing provisions do not apply to Noncommercial Licenses, for which no warranty shall be provided.

**5.2 ****Disclaimers. The express warranties in this Section 5 are in lieu of all other warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory, regarding the Licensed Products, Services or deliverables, including any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, interference with Customer’s quiet enjoyment, and non-infringement of third-party rights. Except for the express warranties stated in this Section 5, the Licensed Products ARE provided “As Is” with all faults, and CUSTOMER ASSUMES the entire risk OF USE OF THE PRODUCTS. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it has not relied on any oral or written information or advice, whether given by Avi Networks, its suppliers, dealers, distributors, agents or employees.**

**6. ****Confidentiality.**

**6.1 **“**Confidential Information**” means, <a name="OLE_LINK6"></a>with respect to Avi Networks information, the Licensed Products, any results of any testing or analysis of the Licensed Products by any party, and with respect to either party’s information, all information that: (a) is marked as confidential or proprietary; (b) is disclosed verbally and identified as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure; or (c) by its nature is normally and reasonably considered confidential.

**6.2 ****Confidentiality**. As a result of the relationship entered into by the parties under this Agreement, each party acknowledges that it may from time to time require or gain access to Confidential Information of the other party. The receiving party: (a) shall hold all Confidential Information in confidence; (b) shall use the Confidential Information only for the purposes expressly permitted herein; (c) shall reproduce the Confidential Information only to the extent necessary for such purpose; (d) shall restrict disclosure of the Confidential Information to its employees, consultants, agents and representatives with a valid need to know in connection with this Agreement and who are bound to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information (and shall advise such employees, agents and representatives of the obligations assumed herein); and (e) shall not otherwise disclose or cause to be disclosed the Confidential Information to any third party without prior written approval of the disclosing party.

**6.3 ****Exceptions**. The foregoing confidentiality restrictions shall not apply to Confidential Information that: (a) is or becomes a part of the public domain through no wrongful act or omission of the receiving party; (b) was in the receiving party’s lawful possession prior to the disclosure and had not been obtained by the receiving party either directly or indirectly from the disclosing party; (c) is lawfully disclosed to the receiving party by a third party without restriction on disclosure; (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without reference to or reliance on the Confidential Information; or (e) that the disclosing party agrees in writing is free of such restrictions. It shall not be a breach of this Section 6 for a party to disclose Confidential Information of the other party (x) in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body or (y) as otherwise required by law, provided, that the party making such a disclosure shall (if permitted) provide prompt prior written notice of the relevant requirement to the party to which the Confidential Information belongs in order to enable such party to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent such disclosure.

**7. ****Infringement Claims.** Avi Networks will defend at its own expense any action against Customer brought by a third party to the extent that the action is based upon a claim that the Licensed Products directly infringe such third party’s copyrights or U.S. patents or misappropriate such third party’s trade secrets, and Avi Networks will pay those costs and damages finally awarded against Customer in any such action that are specifically attributable to such claim or those costs and damages agreed to in a monetary settlement of such action. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on Customer notifying Avi Networks promptly in writing of such action, Customer giving Avi Networks sole control of the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations, and Customer cooperating with Avi Networks and, at Avi Networks’ request and expense, assisting in such defense. If the any element of the Licensed Products becomes, or in Avi Networks’ opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, Avi Networks may, at its option and expense, either (a) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Licensed Products, (b) replace or modify the affected element of the Licensed Products so that it becomes non-infringing, or (c) accept return of the Licensed Products and give Customer a pro-rated refund of the Subscription Fees paid by Customer, based on the remainder of the then-current term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Avi Networks will have no obligation under this Section 7 or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim to the extent based upon (i) any use (including any distribution or export) of the Licensed Products not in accordance with this Agreement or for purposes not intended by Avi Networks, (ii) any use of the Licensed Products in combination with other products, equipment, software, or data not supplied by Avi Networks, (iii) any use of any release of the Licensed Products other than the most current release made available to Customer, or (iv) any modification of the Licensed Products by any person other than Avi Networks or its authorized agents or subcontractors. This Section 7 does not apply to Noncommercial Licenses, for which no indemnification shall be provided by Avi Networks. **THIS SECTION 7 STATES AVI NETWORKS’ ENTIRE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AND ACTIONS.**

**8. ****Indemnification by Customer.**Customer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Avi Networks and its affiliates and licensors harmless from and against any claims, suits, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) brought by a third party against Avi Networks arising out of or relating to: (a) any cause excluded from Avi Networks’ indemnification obligations under Section 7 above, or (b) other than claims subject to indemnification by Avi Networks under Section 7 above, an allegation that such third party has suffered injury, damage or loss resulting from any failure of or defect in the Licensed Products.****

**9. ****Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL AVI NETWORKS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST DATA AND LOST PROFITS, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT EVEN IF AVI NETWORKS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. AVI NETWORKS’ TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE LICENSED PRODUCTS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF SUBSCRIPTION FEES PAID TO AVI NETWORKS HEREUNDER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE SUBSCRIPTION FEES REFLECT THE ALLOCATION OF RISK SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT AVI NETWORKS WOULD NOT ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS ON ITS LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, AVI NETWORKS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY OF ANY KIND OF AVI NETWORKS’ SUPPLIERS.**

**11.10 ****Remedies.** Customer acknowledges that the Licensed Products contain valuable trade secrets and proprietary information of Avi Networks, that any actual or threatened breach of Section 2 will constitute immediate, irreparable harm to Avi Networks for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, and that, without limiting any other remedies hereunder, in such a case Avi Networks will be entitled to equitable and injunctive relief in addition to all other remedies provided by this Agreement or available at law. If any legal action is brought to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to receive its attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other collection expenses, in addition to any other relief it may receive.
