The Administration &gt; Controller page provides information about the Avi Controller (or Avi Controller cluster).

### Avi Controller Table

The Avi Controller table lists the Avi Controllers in the cluster. 

* If Vantage is deployed with a single Avi Controller node, only that Avi Controller is listed.
* If Vantage is deployed as a 3-node Controller cluster, each Controller node is listed. 

The following example is from a deployment that uses a single Controller:

<a href="img/admin-ctlr-list2.png"><img src="img/admin-ctlr-list2.png" alt="admin-ctlr-list2" width="802" height="178" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10520"></a>

The Controller table contains the following information:

* **Name:** Name or IP address of the Avi Controller. 
* **Management IP Address:** Management IP address of the individual Avi Controller node in the cluster. Each Avi Controller in the cluster will have its own management address. 
* **Cluster IP:** The shared management IP address for the cluster, owned by the current leader Avi Controller. 
* **Role:** Shows which Avi Controller is the primary, or leader of the cluster. 
* **State:** The Avi Controller status, such as "Cluster Active."   

## Controller Analytics

This tab configures the Avi Controller management addresses.

If this is a single-node cluster (consists of only this Avi Controller node), the only applicable field is Controller Node-1.

If deploying a 3-node cluster, all fields are applicable:

* **Controller Cluster IP:** The shared management IP address for the cluster.  
* **Management IP:**  
* **Controller Node-1:** Management IP address of node 1. This IP interface belongs only to this Avi Controller node and is not shared by the cluster. 
* **Controller Node-2:** Management IP address of node 2. This IP interface belongs only to this Avi Controller node and is not shared by the cluster. 
* **Controller Node-3:** Management IP address of node 3. This IP interface belongs only to this Avi Controller node and is not shared by the cluster.
