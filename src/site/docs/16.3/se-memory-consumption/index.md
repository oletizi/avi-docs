title: SE Memory Consumption
layout: 16.3
---
Calculating the utilization of memory within a Service Engine is useful to estimate the number of concurrent connections or the amount of memory that may be allocated to features such as HTTP caching.

Service Engines support 1-128 GB memory. Avi's minimum recommendation is 2 GB, though an SE will work with less. Providing more memory greatly increases the scale of capacity, as does adjusting the priorities for memory between concurrent connections and optimized performance buffers.

Changes to the Memory per Service Engine property only impact newly created SEs. For read or no access modes, the memory is configured on the remote orchestrator such as vCenter. Changes to existing SEs require the SE to be powered down prior to the change.

 

### Memory Allocation

Service Engine's memory allocation is summarized in the following three buckets:

<table class=" table table-bordered table-hover">  
<tbody>    
<tr>    
<td><strong>Base<br> </strong></td>
<td>500 MB</td>
<td>Required to turn on the SE (Linux plus basic SE functionality)</td>
</tr>
<tr>    
<td><strong>Local<br> </strong></td>
<td>100 MB / core</td>
<td>Memory allocated per vCPU core</td>
</tr>
<tr>    
<td><strong>Shared<br> </strong></td>
<td>Remaining</td>
<td>Remaining memory is split between <em>Connections</em> and <em>HTTP Cache</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

<a href="img/MemAllocation.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-11516 alignright" src="img/MemAllocation.png" alt="MemAllocation" width="467" height="82"></a>The shared memory pool is divided up between two components, *Connections* and *Buffers*. A minimum of 10% must be allocated to the each. Changing the Connection Memory Percentage slider will impact newly created SEs but will not impact existing SEs.

*Connections* consists of the TCP, HTTP, and SSL connection tables. Memory allocated to connections directly impacts the total concurrent connections a Service Engine can maintain.

*<a href="img/MemoryTable.png"><img class="wp-image-7165 alignleft" src="img/MemoryTable.png" alt="MemoryTable" width="168" height="224"></a>Buffers *consists of application layer packet buffers. These buffers are used for layer 4 through 7 to queue packets to provide improved network performance. For instance, if a client is connected to the Avi SE at 1mb/s with large latency and the server is connected to the SE at no latency and 10gb/s throughput, the server can respond to client queries by transmitting the entire response and move on to service the next client request. The SE will buffer the response and transmit it to the client at the much reduced speed, handling any retransmissions without needing to interrupt the server. This memory allocation also includes application centric features such as HTTP caching and improved compression.

Maximize the number of concurrent connections by changing the priority towards Connections. Avi's benchmark calculations are based on the default setting, which is 20% of the shared memory available for connections.

 

### Concurrent Connections

Most ADC benchmark numbers are based on an equivalent of TCP Fastpath, which uses a simple memory table of client IP:port mapped to server IP:port. This uses very little memory, enabling extremely large concurrent connection numbers. But it is also not relevant to the vast majority of real world deployments which rely on TCP and application layer proxying.  Avi's benchmark numbers are based on full TCP proxy (L4), TCP plus HTTP proxy with buffering and basic caching plus DataScript (L7), and the same scenario with TLS 1.2 between client and Avi.

The memory consumption numbers per connection listed below could be higher or lower. For instance, typical buffered HTTP request headers consume 2k, but they could be as high as 48k. The numbers below are intended to provide real world sizing guidelines, not extreme best or worst case benchmark numbers.

Memory consumption per connection:

* 10 KB L4
* 20 KB L7
* 40 KB L7 + SSL (RSA or ECC) 

To calculate the potential concurrent connections for a Service Engine, use the following formula:

Concurrent L4 connections = ((SE memory - 500 MB - (100 MB /* num vCPU)) /* Connection Percent) / 10 KB

To calculate layer 7 sessions for an SE with 8 vCPU cores and 8 GB RAM, using the default Connection Percent, the math looks like:
((8000 - 500 - ( 100 /* 8 )) /* .20) / 20 KB

<table class=" table table-bordered table-hover">  
<tbody>     
<tr>     
<td></td>
<td><strong>1 vCPU</strong></td>
<td><strong>4 vCPU</strong></td>
<td><strong>32 vCPU</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>     
<td><strong>1 GB</strong></td>
<td>36k</td>
<td>9k</td>
<td>n/a</td>
</tr>
<tr>     
<td><strong>4 GB</strong></td>
<td>306k</td>
<td>279k</td>
<td>27k</td>
</tr>
<tr>     
<td><strong>32 GB</strong></td>
<td>2.82m</td>
<td>2.80m</td>
<td>2.52m</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

The table above shows the number of concurrent connections for L4 (TCP Proxy mode) optimized for connections.

 

### View Allocation via CLI

From the CLI: *show serviceengine <SE Name> memdist*
This command shows a truncated breakdown of memory distribution for the SE. This SE has one vCPU core with 141 MB allocated for the shared memory's connection table. The 'huge_pages' value of 91 means there are 91 pages of 2 MB each. This indicates 182 MB has been allocated for the shared memory's HTTP cache table.

<pre><code class="language-lua">: &gt; show serviceengine Avi-se-bajip memdist
+-------------------------+---------------------------+
| Field                   | Value                     |
+-------------------------+---------------------------+
| se_ref                  | Avi-se-bajip:se-0068b1    |
| huge_pages              | 91                        |
| conn_memory_mb          | 141                       |
| conn_memory_mb_per_core | 141                       |
+-------------------------+---------------------------+</code></pre>  

 

### View Allocation via API

The total memory allocated to the connection table and the percentage in use may be viewed. Use the following commands to query the API:

https://<IP Address>/api/analytics/metrics/serviceengine/se-<SE UUID>?metric_id=se_stats.max_connection_mem_total
Returns the total memory available to the connection table. In the response snippet below, 141 MB is allocated.


<pre><code class="language-lua">"statistics": {
   "max": 141,
}</code></pre>  https://<IP Address>/api/analytics/metrics/serviceengine/se-<SE UUID>?metric_id=se_stats.avg_connection_mem_usage&step=5 
Returns the average percent of memory used during the queried time period. In the result snippet below, 5% of the memory was in use. 

<pre><code class="language-lua">"statistics": {
   "min": 5,
   "max": 5,
   "mean": 5
},</code></pre>
