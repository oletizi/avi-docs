This article describes the fixes in Avi Vantage release 16.3.3.

### Issues Resolved in 16.3.3

* AV-15566: Virtual service placement fails with an incorrect message when the gateway monitor marks an SE down
* AV-15703: In Keystone v3 when a group is assigned a role in a project, a user belonging to that group does not inherit that role
* AV-15754: VS scale out in OpenStack & AWS does not work because traffic from a secondary SE is not being tunneled through the primary SE 

### Known Issues in 16.3.x

* AV-16655: Upgrade from pre-16.3 can fail if disk is >85% full
    * Workaround: Stop the disk monitoring script (*stop monit*) on all the controller nodes
* AV-17053: If static route default gateway is configured on Avi, upgrade from 16.2 or 16.2.1 to 16.3 or later release could be disruptive, leading to reboot of SEs.  After the reboot the SEs will come up normally.
    * Workaround: Upgrade from affected releases (16.2 or 16.2.1) to 16.2.5 first, and then upgrade to 16.3 or later release.
