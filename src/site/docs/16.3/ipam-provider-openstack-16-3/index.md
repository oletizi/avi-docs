Avi Vantage communicates with OpenStack Neutron via APIs to provide IPAM functionality. Currently, DNS services from OpenStack are not supported in this configuration.

Note:

* If you are using OpenStack Cloud in Avi Vantage, then this configuration does not apply, as this is to provide support for other cloud providers who host their VMs/instances in OpenStack (for example, Mesos nodes running on OpenStack instances).

* **Tenant:** Name of the OpenStack tenant.
* **Keystone Host:** IP address or hostname of the Keystone host.
