title: Installing Avi Vantage in an AWS-hosted Mesos Cluster
layout: default
---
Avi Vantage can be deployed as a distributed service proxy (load balancer) for microservices-based applications deployed across thousands of nodes in a Mesos / Marathon environment. The Vantage solution provides visibility and performance monitoring at microservice and service-fabric levels, and autoscales application instances based on real-time traffic and application performance.

Vantage can be installed into a Mesos / Marathon cloud hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) using the AWS console or using the CLI.
