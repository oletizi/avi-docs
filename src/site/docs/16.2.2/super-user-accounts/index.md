Vantage user accounts can be enabled for super user access. Super user access provides write access to all resources within Vantage, and also automatically provides access to all tenants.

The ***admin*** account that is created during installation of the Avi Controller automatically has super user access enabled.

Optionally, super user access can be enabled in other user accounts, on an individual basis.

To enable super access for a Vantage user account, select the Super User checkbox in the account configuration:
