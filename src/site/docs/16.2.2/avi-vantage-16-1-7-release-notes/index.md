## Avi Vantage 16.1.7

This release contains fixes but no new features.

### Issues Resolved in 16.1.7

* AV-10806: VIP port numbers higher than 6000 did not work.
* AV-10785: Avi Service Engine (SE) could fail if the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) field in the HTTP header of a packet was too long.
* AV-10765: Following upgrade, the primary SE for a virtual service did not accept TCP connections. 

<a name="1616"></a>

## Avi Vantage 16.1.6

This release contains fixes but no new features.

### Issues Resolved in 16.1.6

* AV-10642: Avi Service Engines (SEs) did not correctly handle TCP out-of-band (OOB) data.
* AV-10635: Packet buffer leak could occur when back-end UDP servers were down.
* AV-10572: Configuration change to TCP/UDP profile could cause the ending port number of the virtual service port range to be incorrectly set to 0. 

<a name="1615"></a>

## Avi Vantage 16.1.5

This release contains a fix but no new features.

### Issues Resolved in 16.1.5

* AV-10631: APIC: VRF associated with Bridge Domains was not updated in the Avi Controller upon upgrade. 

<a name="1614"></a>

## Avi Vantage 16.1.4

This release contains fixes but no new features.

### Issues Resolved in 16.1.4

* AV-10520: Postgres failure during Avi Controller upgrade causes the upgrade to be aborted.
* AV-10362: APIC: Logical interface (LIf) sharing did not work across Virtual Routing Frameworks (VRFs) for APIC graph instances. 

<a name="1613"></a>

## Avi Vantage 16.1.3

This release adds a new cookie persistence option, to enable or disable including Set-Cookie headers in every request of a connection that is not using the Cookie header.

Note: In 16.1.3, this new option is supported only in the REST API.

### Issues Resolved in 16.1.3

* AV-10313: When a virtual service was scaled out across two or more Avi SEs, packets could be dropped between the primary SE and the secondary SE due to maximum transmission unit (MTU) limits.
* AV-9584: Error threshold for packets with TCP window size 0 adjusted to reduce unnecessary significant logs. (Default threshold changed to a minimum of 5 events or 2% of total traffic for the virtual service.)
* AV-9579: In certain circumstances, the postgres database could fail to start on a follower Avi Controller node in a 3-node Controller cluster. This caused the configuration on the follower node to go out of sync.
* AV-9481: OpenSSL upgraded to v1.0.2h.
* AV-9319: Accept-Encoding headers for gzip packets were incorrectly rewritten.
* AV-9315: IP forwarding for the Avi Controller was unnecessarily enabled in non-container infrastructures.
* AV-9248: (OpenStack) If a project’s UUID changed (for example, because a project was recreated in Keystone), but an older tenant with the same UUID still existed in Vantage, this caused issues with logging into the newly created tenant.
* AV-9022: If an Avi SE failed to reconnect following upgrade, the upgrade could take longer.
* AV-9005: Long Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) could cause an Avi SE to stop working.

## Avi Vantage 16.1.2

This release contains fixes but no new features.

### Issues Resolved in 16.1.2

* AV-8761 APIC: Use of Avi Vantage Service Graphs across VRFs was not supported.
* AV-8718 Mesos: Setting the A/B pool ratio caused task restart and service disruption. This occurred when labels were used. Vantage 16.1.2 supports using the API to set the A/B ratio for Mesos.
* AV-8717 APIC: VIPs are registered as part of the Device Selection Policy for the APIC DSR feature.
* AV-8709 Vantage did not support TCP SYNs in which the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) or Congestion Window Reduced (CWR) features were enabled. SYNs in which either the ECN or CWR option was enabled were dropped.
* AV-8701 OpenStack: If the management session was switched to a non-admin tenant, private SE group flavors did not appear in the SE group edit window.
* AV-8614 Web interface: If the advanced workflow (Create Virtual Service > Advanced Setup) was used to create a virtual service for an OpenStack or AWS cloud, the configuration failed.
* AV-8496 Upgrade: If the pool down action for a pool was set to local response, upgrade from a previous version to 16.1.x would fail. If this occurred, the following exception (error) message was generated: Enum POOL_DOWN_HTTP_STATUS_CODE_503 not found in enum type FailHttpStatusCode 

<a name="1611"></a>

## Avi Vantage 16.1.1

Avi Vantage 16.1.1 adds support for Internet Explorer (IE) version 11, and contains the following fixes.

### Issues Resolved in 16.1.1

* AV-8251 The SE did not receive a certificate bundle from the Controller in some cases.
* AV-8212 CLI: Maximum transmission unit (MTU) could not be set for a cloud using the CLI.
* AV-8208 OpenStack: Upload of SE image would fail if raw image format was used.
* AV-8163 The Host header was mistakenly omitted from client logs.
* AV-8086 SE could stop working during very heavy test load of SSL traffic.
* AV-8071 The Controller allowed multiple instances of the same health monitor to be attached to the same pool, which is an invalid configuration.
* AV-7924 Web interface: The port number not preserved when editing a pool. If the port number was edited and the field was then cleared again, the previous port number was not retained and had to be typed into the field.
