## Create a New Document

**Step 1:** Create a directory for the article in the relevant documentation version.

**Step 2:** Create a file called `index.md` in that directory

**Step 3:** Add the Jekyll frontmatter to the article. It looks like this:
<pre>
---
title: Article CRUD Basics
layout: default
---    
</pre>
Feel free to copy it from this document and paste it into your new document, then change the title. Leave the `layout` directive set to `default`

**Step 4:** Add your article text and save your document. See <a href="/docs/16.2.2/meta/article-authoring-basics">Authoring Basics</a> for basic
