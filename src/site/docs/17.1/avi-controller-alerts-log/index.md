The Administration &gt; Controller &gt; Alerts page lists Avi Controller-related alerts. 

This page automatically filters the Vantage alerts log to display only those alerts related to Avi Controller operation. The same alerts also are included in the alerts log accessed by <a href="{% vpath %}/configuration-guide/operations/alerts/">Operations &gt; Alerts</a>. The same search options also are supported.
&gt; Note: Alerts are generated only if <a href="{% vpath %}/alert-config">configured</a> by the Vantage user.
