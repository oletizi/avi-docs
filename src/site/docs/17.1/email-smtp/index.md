Avi Vantage may proactively send emails. This may be done for password reset operations, or as a result of a triggered alert action that calls for email notifications to be sent to administrators or monitoring systems. Emails are sent from the Avi Controller, which means the Avi Controller will require <a href="{% vpath %}/dns-ntp-settings">DNS </a>and network access to a destination email server.

The SMTP source is where the email will be sourced from when the Avi Controller is sending an email.

*Note: Avi Vantage only supports TLS-enabled SMTP servers.*
