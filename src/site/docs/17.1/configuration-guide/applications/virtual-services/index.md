Virtual services are the core of the Vantage Vantage load-balancing and proxy functionality. A virtual service advertises an IP address and ports to the external world and listens for client traffic. When a virtual service receives traffic, it may be configured to:

* Proxy the client's network connection.
* Perform security, acceleration, load balancing, gather traffic statistics, and other tasks.
* Forward the client's request data to the destination pool for load balancing. 

A virtual service can be thought of as an IP address that Vantage is listening to, ready to receive requests. In a normal TCP/HTTP configuration, when a client connects to the virtual service address, Vantage will process the client connection or request against a list of settings, policies and profiles, then send valid client traffic to a back-end server that is listed as a member of the virtual service’s pool.

Typically, the connection between the client and Vantage is terminated or proxied at the SE, which opens a new TCP connection between itself and the server. The server will respond back directly to the Vantage IP address, not to the original client address. Vantage forwards the response to the client via the TCP connection between itself and the client.

A typical virtual service consists of a single IP address and service port that uses a single network protocol. Vantage allows a virtual service to listen to multiple service ports or network protocols.

For instance, a virtual service could be created for both service port 80 (HTTP) and 443 SSL (HTTPS). In this example, clients can connect to the site with a non-secure connection and later be redirected to the encrypted version of the site. This allows administrators to manage a single virtual service instead of two. Similarly, protocols such as DNS, RADIUS and Syslog can be accessed via both UDP and TCP protocols.

It is possible to create two unique virtual services, where one is listening on port 80 and the other is on port 443; however, they will have separate statistics, logs, and reporting. They will still be owned by the same Service Engines (SEs) because they share the same underlying virtual service IP address.

To send traffic to destination servers, the virtual service internally passes the traffic to the pool corresponding to that virtual service. A virtual service normally uses a single pool, though an advanced configuration using policies or DataScripts can perform content switching across multiple pools. A script also can be used in lieu of a pool, such as a virtual service that only performs an HTTP redirect.

A pool can only be assigned to a single virtual service. If the virtual service is deleted or pointed at a different pool, the pool will become unassigned and available to be used by a different virtual service.

When creating a virtual service, that virtual service listens to the client-facing network, which is most likely the upstream network where the default gateway exists. The pool connects to the server network.

Normally, the combined virtual service and pool are required before Vantage can place either object on an SE. When making an SE placement decision, Vantage must choose the SE that has the best reachability or network access to both client and server networks. Alternatively, both the clients and servers may be on the same IP network.

### Virtual Service Page

Select Applications > Virtual Services to open the virtual services page. This page displays a list of the configured virtual services. It can be used to quickly check the status and view high level information for each.

This page includes the following functions:

<a href="img/icon_search.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1086 alignleft" src="img/icon_search.png" alt="icon_search" width="60" height="18"></a>  **Search:** Search through the names of the objects.

<a href="img/icon_new.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1087 alignleft" src="img/icon_new.png" alt="icon_new" width="60" height="18"></a>  **Create:** Opens the *Create Virtual Service*popup.

<a href="img/icon_edit_white.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1088 alignleft" src="img/icon_edit_white.png" alt="icon_edit_white" width="60" height="18"></a>  **Edit:** Opens the *Edit Virtual Service*popup.

<a href="img/icon_delete.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1089 alignleft" src="img/icon_delete.png" alt="icon_delete" width="60" height="18"></a>  **Delete:** Immediately removes a virtual service from Vantage. This will terminate all existing connections, delete the configuration of the virtual service, and place the pools used by that virtual service into an unused state. When deleting, a secondary prompt will ask to remove the pool at the same time or leave it intact. The SEs hosting the virtual service may be eligible for deletion if they are no longer in use. Note that an object cannot be un-deleted.

The table on this page contains the following information for each virtual service. The columns are customizable, so the exact view may be different.
