This article describes the workflow of cases submitted by Avi customers to Avi Support. Be it initiated over the phone or directly via the Avi Customer Portal, a case can be viewed and managed by visiting <a href="http://www.avinetworks.com/portal">www.avinetworks.com/portal</a>. Read <a href="/docs/17.1/using-the-avi-customer-portal/">Using the Avi Customer Portal</a> for full details on support case submission and tracking.

Four case types are defined: issue, bug, enhancement and question. As a case moves toward resolution, it may be reclassified, and therefore its type may change, as shown in the third column of the below table.

### Case Types and Reclassification

Fundamentally, a customer will submit a case to Avi Support for just one of two reasons:
<ol> 
 <li>S/he has question, or</li> 
 <li>S/he is having trouble with Avi's product.</li> 
</ol> 

Be it a question or trouble, it would be unfair to expect a customer to accurately predict the ultimate resolution of the case. For example,

* How can a customer be sure s/he is observing defective product behavior as opposed to missing functionality within the product?
* If a customer asks a "how to" question, how can s/he be sure there is an answer? It is conceivable there currently is no way for the product to do what the customer asks; an enhancement may be necessary. 

For these reasons, when creating the case, the most reasonable starting point for the customer is to choose between a type of "issue" or "question." Let Avi Support worry about reclassifying it, if need be.

On the other hand, when the customer creates a case on the Customer Portal, s/he is permitted a choose any one of the four types. The customer's classification may indeed be correct, but observe the following situations requiring a change:

* The customer surmises an *enhancement* is required.  
    * Avi Support determines the existing product is indeed designed to deliver that functionality, but is being impeded by a *bug*.
    * Avi Support concludes not enough is known about the observed behavior to determine existing functionality is missing or defective. The case is up-leveled to an *issue *pending additional data gathering.
* The customer believes a *bug* is the root cause of his/her problem.  
    *  Avi Support determines functionality is absent, as opposed to errant. The case is reclassified as an *enhancement*.
    * Avi Support concludes not enough is known about the observed behavior to determine existing functionality is missing or defective. The case is up-leveled to an *issue *pending additional data gathering.
